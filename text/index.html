    <h1>
        JAVASCRIPT EVENTS
    </h1>

    <p>
        Today, most of the web apps somehow interact with the user or   dynamically change their content depending on the information they receive from the server. 
        So, what’s the event?
    </p>

    <h3>
        Event
    </h3>

    <p>
        Event is action that take place in the programmable system that the system tells you about, so that you can react to them somehow, if necessary.
        For example, if a user clicks a button on a web page, you can respond by displaying an information window </p>
    <p>
        In WEB,  events are started inside the browser window and, as a rule, are attached to a specific element that is in it.
        This can be a single element, a set of elements, an HTML document loaded on the current tab, or the whole browser window. 
        There are many different events that can happen, such as:
        Mouse events: for example ‘click’, ‘contextmenu’, ‘mousepover/mouseout’ etc. 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Form element events: such as ‘focus’, ‘submit’</li>
            <li>Keyboard events  such as ‘keydown’, ‘keyup’</li>
            <li>Document events, CSS events, And many other. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Full list of javascript events and their description you сan see on the website <a>https://developer.mozilla.org</a> in in the section of Event’
    </p>    

    <h3>
        Event handlers
    </h3>

    <p>To react on events we can assign a handler – a function that runs in case of an event. There are several ways to assign a handler. </p>
    <p>A handler can be set in HTML with an attribute named on event; But An HTML-attribute is not a convenient place to write a lot of code, 
        so we’d better create a JavaScript function and call it there. </p>
    <p>We can bind the function created in the script and point to it in the event attribute of the element in html.</p>
    <p>Also We can assign a handler using a DOM property on  и &lt;event&gt;.</p>
    <p>For instance, elem.onclick:</p>
    <p>If the handler is assigned using an HTML-attribute then the browser reads it, creates a new function from the attribute content and writes it to the DOM property.</p>
    <p>So this way is actually the same as the previous one.</p>
        <h5>
            addEventListener()
        </h5> 
    <p>The fundamental problem of the aforementioned ways to assign handlers – we can’t assign multiple handlers to one event. Web-standard developers understood that 
        long ago and suggested an another way of managing handlers using special methods <i>addEventListener</i>  and <i>removeEventListener.</i></p>
    <p>They are free of such a problem. This is a syntax  to add the handler: </p>

    <p> where event -is event name; handler – the handler function; options</p>
    <p>An additional optional object with properties of adding the handler: 
        To remove a handler we should pass exactly the same function as was assigned. 
        Please note – if we don’t store the function in a variable, then we can’t remove it. There’s no way to “read back” handlers assigned by addEventListener.</p>  
       <h5>
        Event tobjects
       </h5>
        
    <p>Now,  the event handler function are passed an argument: the event object. This object holds additional information about the event. 
        For example, if we want to know which mouse button was pressed, we can look at the event object’s button property.
        The information stored in an event object differs per type of event</p>


        <h3>
            Prevent Default()
        </h3>
    

	<p>Many events automatically trigger a browser action. For example:  Clicking on a link initiates a new URL.
    Clicking on the "send" button in the form sends it to the server.Double click on the text - initiates its selection.</p>
	<p>If we process an event in JavaScript, we often do not need such a browser action. Fortunately, it can be cancelled.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to cancel the browser's activations:</p>
	<p>The main way is to use the object of the event. There is a built-in method of event.preventDefault() to cancel a browser action.</p>
	<p>If the handler is assigned via an event handler (not via addEventListener), you can simply return false from the handler.
    Bubbling and capturing</p>
	<p>When an event is initiated by an element that has parental elements  modern browsers perform two different phases - the capture phase and the bubbling phase.</p>
	<p> In the capture phase, the following occurs: </p>
	<p> - The browser checks whether the most external element (html as rule) has the event handler registered on it at the capture stage and launches it if so.</p>
	<p> - It then moves on to the next element inside <html> and does the same, then the next and so on until it reaches the element where the event occurred. </p>
	<p> The exact opposite is happening in the bubbling phase: </p>
	<p>The browser checks whether the item on which the event actually occurred has an event handler registered on it in the bubbling phase, and launches it if so. </p>
	<p>It then moves on to the next direct parent element and does the same, then the next and so on until it reaches the &lt;html&gt; element. </p>
	<p>In modern browsers all event handlers are registered in the bubbling phase by default.</p>

    <h3>
        StopPropagation
    </h3>

    <p>The standard event object has a function called stopPropagation(), which when called in the object's event handler, makes the handler run,
        but the event does not pop up along the chain, so no other handlers will be started.</p>

    <h3>
        Summary
    </h3>

	<p>Event handlers make it possible to detect and react to events happening in ourweb page. 
        TheaddEventListener method is used to register such a handler. Each event has a type ("keydown","focus", and so on) that identifies it. 
        Most events are called on a specific DOM element and then propagate to that element’s ancestors, allowing handlers associated with those elements to handle them.
        When an event handler is called, it is passed an event object with additiona linformation about the event. 
        This object also has methods that allow us to stop further propagation (stopPropagation) and prevent the browser’s defaul thandling of the event (preventDefault).
        Pressing a key fires "keydown" and" keyup "events. Pressing a mouse button fires "mousedown","mouseup", and"click"events. 
        Moving the mouse fires "mousemove" events. Touchscreen interaction will result in "touchstart" , "touchmove", and "touchend" events .
        Scrolling can be detected with the"scroll" event, and focus changes can be detected with the "focus" and "blur" events. 
        When the document finishes loading, a "load" event fires on the window.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you.</p>
